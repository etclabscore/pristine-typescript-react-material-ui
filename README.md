# Pristine Typescript React Materal UI

An open source repository in its original condition. It leverages Typescript, React, Material UI theming, moment.js and i18next to give a good starting point for new and existing projects.

Pristine Typescript React Material UI is a fork of [Pristine](https://github.com/etclabscore/pristine).

There are a lack of repositories to start from to build community driven, multi-language open source projects. This is a complete starting point, it follows a Documentation Driven Development approach, and can be used as a resource to augment existing documentation.

## Documentation Driven Development

There are many ways to drive open source development. Documenting the problem in the README gives a middle ground between technical and non-technical specifications. This allows organizing solutions to this challenge around community and documentation.

> [...] a beautifully crafted library with no documentation is also damn near worthless. If your software solves the wrong problem or nobody can figure out how to use it, there’s something very bad going on.

### Conventions and Specifications

Using conventions, documentation and specifications make it easier to:
- communicate the problem you are solving
- ease onboarding
- build and use composable tools
